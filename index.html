        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Fernando Montiel, and I am currently a student at Lewis University majoring in Computer Science.
            My family is a big part of my life and one of my main motivations to keep pushing forward and improving myself.
            I chose this major because I enjoy problem-solving, working with technology, and learning how things work behind the scenes.
